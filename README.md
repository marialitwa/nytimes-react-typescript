# The New York Times - Top Stories

With this web app you can check the latest Top Stories published by The New York times. To read more about the displayed articles you need to register and login as a user.

I developed the **React** web app as part of my professional education as a **_Fullstack Web Developer_** at Code Academy Berlin. For the authentication, authorization and database I’m using **Firebase** web services. To get the data I’m working with the **RESTful API** offered by The New York Times for Developers. [Check it out here.](https://developer.nytimes.com/apis) 

**Please watch out: This app is work in progress**. Next, I'm working on the feature to save bookmarks to save articles for a later read, and a global improvement of UX/UI.
